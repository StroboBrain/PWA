### Planing Phase 3 conclusion

|Task name|Estimated time in hours|Total time needed|Expected problem|Experienced problems|
|-----|----|----|-----|-----|
|Compare the different Sudoku libary|2|1|Problems with a libary will only show up later in developement stage|There were not that many libaries available. I chose the https://github.com/robatron/sudoku.js/ libary, because it is very simple|
|Integrate the libary into sudoKUH|4|1|I expect a lot of trouble in this step, to get the libary correct running in this project|To integrate the libary in this porject was as simple as just importing the sudoku.js file and using it's methode|
|Review the current sudoKUH code and gain and further understanding|6|15|I need to study some basic theory on JavaScript, because my experience with this language is very limited|As expected I faced a lot of problems here and lost a lot of time, because I tried from scratch using the PWA-Bulder for VSC code. So I had to switch from IntelliJ. But after several hours I decided to go back to the old prototype and work on it|

### Project Status:
The sudoKUH app is hosted directly from the gitHub repository and can be accessed here: https://strobobrain.github.io/sudoKUH/ it contains a rudimentary version and allows to solve Sudokus by pressing the empty squares.
