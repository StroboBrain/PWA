#### Detailed descriptions
##### Create a scribble for the interface
###### Details come later
Keep the scribble as simple as possible and do not obsess over small details. The scribble is only a guide and not the final product.
###### No overinvesting
Do not invest too much time for the scribble. The first idea might be as good as the 100th idea.
###### Work in cycles
I have already a UI as a first cycle. Now it is time to improve that UI and adjust the things I do not like. I try to program it this time a bit more flexible, so it can be adjusted in the future more easily.

###### Final scribble

##### Update the UI for Edge
- Spend some time to get back into the code. It's been 10 weeks since I worked on this code.
- Create a div that holds the game, that will be adjusted to the screen size. The goal must be, that the Sudoku is always a square.
