# Description
This repository holds the documentation of the developement of the pwa sudoKUH. This is a project for the Seminar "Software Engineering" at the University of Bern. It is a casestudy for the deveopement of a progressive web application (PWA).

# Research Question: 
What are the differences between the expected and occuring problems during the developement of a PWA.

## Motivation
It is normal to encounter problems during software development and I was curious if I could predict them. 

## Research methode
Together with Timo we decided, that I would conduct a casestudy based on my own PWA project sudoKUH. Which is a basic PWA that allows the user to play a Sudoku.
